                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mark Kenneth Laqui Ustare. I am originally from the Philippines but have been living in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, since 2008 with my family. <br>
                I was born and raised in the Philippines, spending my childhood on a beautiful island in the province of Quezon. In 2006, I graduated with a degree in Broadcast Communication from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. After graduation, I worked for a few years in the Philippines before moving to Abu Dhabi to explore new opportunities.<br>
                In 2012, I was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a life-changing milestone for me. Later, I discovered PathwayConnect, which reignited my passion for learning. From 2020 to 2024, I pursued my studies at BYU-Idaho, earning a bachelor's degree in Marriage and Family Studies in July 2024.<br>
                Currently, I am continuing my education with a new goal: earning a degree in Applied Technology. I look forward to this exciting journey of growth and discovery.</p>
